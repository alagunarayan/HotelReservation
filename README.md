# HotelReservationAn owner of a boutique hotel asked you to develop a program to help him assign
available rooms to his guests. Your program must find the nearest available room
measured by the route taken from the entrance to the room (see diagram) and assign it
to the guest. Given that:
• The hotel has 4 floors and there are 5 rooms on each floor
• Rooms are numbered by the floor as prefix followed by a single alphabet suffix A,
B, C, D or E where A is the first room (relative to the entrance) until E for the last
room.
